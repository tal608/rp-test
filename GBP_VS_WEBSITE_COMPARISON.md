# Google Business Profile vs Website Alignment Check

## 🔍 Critical NAP (Name, Address, Phone) Consistency

### **Website Data:**
- **Business Name:** River Paws
- **Address:** 5305 River Road, Waunakee, WI 53597
- **Phone:** (608) 571-PAWS / 608-571-7297
- **Email:** YaharaRiverPaws@gmail.com

### **Check GBP for:**
- ✅ **Name matches exactly:** "River Paws" (no variations like "River Paws Dog Grooming" unless that's your official name)
- ✅ **Address is identical:** "5305 River Road, Waunakee, WI 53597" (no abbreviations unless consistent)
- ✅ **Phone format matches:** Should be either "(608) 571-7297 or 608-571-7297" (same format as website)
- ⚠️ **If different, FIX IMMEDIATELY** - NAP inconsistency kills local rankings

## 📅 Business Hours Alignment

### **Website Hours:**

### **Check GBP:**
- ✅ Hours match exactly (including "Closed" vs "Not open")
- ⚠️ **Special hours:** If you have different hours for grooming vs hiking, document both
- 📝 **Note:** Website shows hiking is "Tuesday through Friday" - consider if grooming hours differ

### **Potential Issue:**
- Website mentions hiking is "Tuesday through Friday" but general hours show "Monday-Friday"
- **Action:** Clarify if Monday is only for assessments or if regular services are available
