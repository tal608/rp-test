  {
    question: "Do you do Puppy Grooming?",
    answer: "Yes! Starting grooming routines early with a puppy is important for their physical health and emotional well-being. Puppy grooming acclimates them to being handled, which is essential for vet visits and future grooming appointments. Puppies are much more open to new experiences than older dogs, so early acclimation helps create positive associations with grooming that last a lifetime. Puppies can begin gentle grooming experiences as early as 12 weeks old, once they've received their initial vaccinations. At River Paws, our experienced groomers specialize in making puppy grooming a positive, stress-free experience that your puppy will look forward to.",
