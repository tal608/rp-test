## ⚠️ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT (Why Not 10/10)

### 1. Content & E-E-A-T: 6.5/10
**Score: Needs Improvement**

**Current State:**
- ✅ Service descriptions present
- ✅ FAQs on pages
- ✅ ✅ Testimonials/reviews on site
- ❌ Limited depth content (no blog/resources)
- ❌ Team credentials not prominently displayed
- ❌ No detailed staff bios with qualifications

**E-E-A-T Breakdown:**
- **Experience**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Since 2017, testimonials show experience)
- **Expertise**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Good service descriptions, but could add more expertise signals)
- **Authoritativeness**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Needs more backlinks, citations, partnerships)
- **Trustworthiness**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Reviews, testimonials, clear contact info)

**Recommendations:**
1. Add blog/resources section with:
   - "How to prepare your dog for first grooming"
   - "Grooming tips for different coat types"
   - "Best practices for puppy grooming"
2. Enhance team page with:
   - Years of experience
   - Certifications/training
   - Specializations
3. Get featured in local media or pet care publications

**Impact:** Medium-High. E-E-A-T is increasingly important for Google, especially in competitive niches.

### 2. Performance (Core Web Vitals): 7.5/10
**Score: Estimated - Needs Testing**

**Implemented Optimizations:**
✅ Next.js Image component with AVIF/WebP formats  
✅ Image compression enabled  
✅ SWC minification  
✅ Proper image sizing  

**Unknown (Needs Testing):**
- ⚠️ **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)** - Should be < 2.5s

- ⚠️ **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)** - Should be < 0.1
- ⚠️ **FCP (First Contentful Paint)** - Should be < 1.8s

**Recommendations:**
1. Run Google PageSpeed Insights
2. Test with Lighthouse
3. Implement resource hints (preconnect, dns-prefetch)
4. Consider lazy loading for below-fold content
5. Optimize font loading (font-display: swap)

**Impact:** High. Core Web Vitals are a ranking factor. Your Next.js setup is good, but actual metrics matter.
